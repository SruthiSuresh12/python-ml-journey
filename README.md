# 🧠 Python to Machine Learning: A Day-by-Day Journey

Welcome to my hands-on daily learning project that progresses from basic Python to advanced machine learning, using Jupyter Notebooks and practical exercises.

## 🗓️ Structure

Each day covers a new topic or skill with corresponding notebooks:

- `Day1_Basics.ipynb`: Python syntax, variables, strings, numbers, and formatting.

> More days will be added progressively.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda recommended)
- Git (for version control)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/python-ml-journey.git
cd python-ml-journey
